# Marvin
Essentials for Marvin LoRa Development

## Getting started

### Install Arduino IDE

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and follow the installer. 

If you want to donate to Arduino -to help developing their software we are thanksfully using- this is possible, but not mandatory.

### Connect Marvin to computer

Use your left or right (or a combination) hand to push the Marvin in the USB port of your computer. Your computer will quickly befriend it and say "blingBLING", which is computer language for "We are now BFFs!".

### Upload Blinky

LINK TO BLINKY

Download Blinky.ino and open it in the Arduino IDE

From the 'Tools' menu select 'Arduino Leonardo' in the 'Boards' section.

Click upload to send the software to the Marvin. If all went well it will say Uploading complete and the second LED will blink, if not try uploading again.
